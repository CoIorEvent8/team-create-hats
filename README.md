Terribly sorry, this plugin is currently underconstruction. I didn't think to separate my changes into another branch since I'm the only contributor, so if you'd like to download the plugin then go to the 'old' folder and download the .rbxmx file from there. Make sure to check back soon as this will probably updated in the coming few days.


Old README:

If you're just looking to install the plugin, download the .rbxmx file into your plugins folder in roblox studio.

If you'd like to modify the code, set the heirarchy up like this:

and modify what you'd like.
If you fix a bug or add a cool feature feel free to make a pull request!
