Team Create Hats Plugin for Roblox Studio.

If you're just looking to install the plugin, download the .rbxmx file into your plugins folder in roblox studio.

If you'd like to modify the code, set the heirarchy up like this:
![heiarchy with main in a folder and scripts beneath main](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510610831692529681/661319440885088282/unknown.png)
and modify what you'd like.
If you fix a bug or add a cool feature feel free to make a pull request!
